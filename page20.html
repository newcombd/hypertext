	<p>Well.</p>
	<h1>Here we are.</h1>
	<p>Sorry I couldn't let you see more. <strong>DO</strong> more. </p>
<br />
	<p>Sometimes it's better to keep people at a distance.</p>
<br />
	<p>Sometimes it's better to not show them what you really see and feel.</p>
<br />
	<p>I do feel sad sometimes. All the time, in fact. But that's ok.<p />
<br>
	<p>I know that it's not forever. I know that people feel things differently. And that I'm not always in control over my feelings, or what other people think of me.</p>
<br />
	<p>I'm not in control of their feelings either, whether I can see them or not. </p>
<br />
	<p>And in saying this I realize that there's one other person whose thoughts we haven't looked at.</p>
<br />
	<p>How are  <i>you</i>?</p>
